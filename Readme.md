# Career Development Plan

## Project Description

The Career Development Plan Kanban Board is a simple project management tool designed to help aspiring developers organize and track their progress toward launching a new career. Inspired by agile principles, it uses a classic Kanban layout with three stages—TODO, DOING, and DONE—to visually manage tasks and milestones. The board promotes focus, persistence, and structured growth, offering users a clear overview of their journey. Although centred on tech careers, the concept can be easily adapted for various goals and projects.
